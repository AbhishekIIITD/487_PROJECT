A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A React framework for production-grade applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Swiper: A modern mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions.

## Features

- Carousel: This project uses Swiper to create a carousel component. The carousel allows users to navigate through a series of items, which can be any kind of content.
- Responsive Design: The layout of this project adjusts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on a variety of devices.
- Custom Fonts: Due to time constraints and the lack of explicit font requirements, a similar-looking font was used in this project.

Due to time constraints, this project does not include additional animations. Future updates may include more interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
